1. Remix is composed of a number of panels.

1. In the **main panel** of Remix, make sure you see the **landing page**.  To navigate to the landing page, click the Remix icon ![Remix icon](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/blob/basics7/Basics/1_Load_and_compile/images/https://github.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/blob/basics7/Basics/1_Interface_Introduction/images/a-layout1c.png?raw=true "Remix icon") on the top of the icon panel.

2. In the **Environments** section, click the **Solidity** button.  This button will activate a number of plugins - youâ€™ll see them in the icon panel (if they haven't already been activated).

4. Alternatively, you can activate plugins one at a time with the plugin manager. ![plugin manager](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/blob/basics7/Basics/1_Interface_Introduction/images/plugin1.png?raw=true "plugin manager icon")
