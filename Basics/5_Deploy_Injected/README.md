# Deploying to a test net.

### Steps
1. Download MetaMask. 

2. Click the MetaMask icon in your browser. Sign in and choose a test network. 

3. Get some test ETHER for that network. If, for example, you had selected Goerli Network then, search for `Goerli faucet` and you'll find a website where you can get some test ether. 

2. Go back to Remix. In  **Deploy & Run**, in the **Environment** pulldown, choose **Injected Web3**.

3. See if you can deploy your compiled 2_Owner.sol to the test net that you have just chosen. If you see the 2_Owner.sol as a choice in the **CONTRACT** select box, click the **Deploy** button.  
    - If you see nothing in this select box, you'll need to compile ballot.sol again.  And if you do need to compile 2_Owner.sol again,  make sure it is the active file in the **editor** and then go to the **Solidity Compiler** to compile it.  

    - And then, go to the **Deploy & Run** plugin and deploy to the network you've chosen in step 2.

5. You'll see the MetaMask popup asking you to pay for the transactions.
