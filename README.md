# Welcome to the Remix workshop


### Getting started:


**1. Open Remix**

https://remix.ethereum.org

Alternatively you can clone https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide and run `npm install && npm run build && npm run serve`


**2. Open support chat**

https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix-workshop

We are here to help out and answer any question you might have.


 **Additional links**

Remixd repository repository https://github.com/ethereum/remixd

**3. Sign into Github**

Github will block too many requests from the same location - unless you are signed into github and input a token.  This is only an issue during workshops - but because we are in a workshop, we need to do these steps:

    - In one browser window - go to remix.ethereum.org and go to the settings tab
    - In another browser window go to: 
    
    https://github.com/settings/tokens 
    
    and create a new token and save it in Remix in the you just opened on the settings tab.
