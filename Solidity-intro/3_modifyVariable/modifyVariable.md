# Modify a variable

A Solidity `function` works in a similar way to functions in other programming languages, in that they accept parameters, process them, and return variables.

To let a function in your contract be accessable from external contracts, you declare it as public using the `public` function modifier.

To recap, the syntax for a function based on what we have discussed so far is:

```solidity
function <functionName>(<parameterType> <parameterName>â€¦) <functionModifiers> returns (<returnVariableTypes>) {
    // Code
}
```

## Try it out!

Create a new function called `set` that other contracts can access that accepts one parameter of type `uint`.

Inside the function, set the state variable you created in step 2 to the value of the parameter.
