# The Basics

## Deploy and interact with a contract deployed to a the Ropsten test net.

### Problem Statment
When you deploy a contract to a realistic test net, you need to have test Ether to interact with the contract.  How do you do that?

### Steps
1. Download MetaMask & get an address.

2. Try out the Ropsten test net - you'll need Ropsten Ether - get some and have it sent to your Ropsten address.

3. Deploy the ballot to Ropsten.  And pay for the deployment through metamask.
