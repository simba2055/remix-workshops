# Deploying to a test net.

### Steps
1. Download MetaMask. 

2. Click the MetaMask icon in your browser. Sign in and choose a test network. 

3. Get some test ETHER for that network. Searching for Rinkeby faucet or whatever test network you want to use followed by the work **faucet**.

2. Go back to Remix. In the deploy plugin, in the **Environment** pulldown, choose **Injected Web3**.

3. See if you can deploy your compiled ballot.sol to another network. If you see the Ballot.sol choice in the pulldown menu above the Deploy button - click it.  If you see nothing in this pulldown menu, you'll need to compile ballot.sol again.  So make sure it is the active file in the tabs and then go to the **Solidity** plugin to compile it.  

4. Go to the **Deploy & Run** plugin and deploy to the network you've chosen in step 2.

5. You'll see the MetaMask popup asking you to pay for the transactions.
