# Proxy Contract also known as Dispatcher

## Why?

This is a great pattern which is used mainly in library development. It helps to solve following problems.
- **Save gas cost at deployment time**
The purpose of cost is to limit the amount of work that is needed to execute the transaction and to pay for this execution. It's tied with the size of it.
The proxy contract is usefull when a lot of instances of the same contract required to be deployed.
- **Avoid code repetition in the blockchain.**
Heavy computations are expensive because every node will need to perform it, therefore slowing the network.
- **Develop upgradable(versioned) contracts**
When the contract is deployed, itâ€™s immutable. By re-designing the code into different contracts, it is possible to allow logic upgrades while keeping the storage the same.

## Example of gas cost

Storing contract code at creation time can cost up to:
 - 200 * max_byte_code_length gas
 - 200 * 24576 = 49152004915200 * 10 gwei = 49152000 gwei = 0.049152 ether = 9 EUR
